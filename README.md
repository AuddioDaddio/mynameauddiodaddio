Just a brief explanation:

Apologies for the cluster-fuck organization-that I have of a repositroy.
Didn't think ahead of the game...

There's 3 different branches; master, Xtras, & SimpleNetworks.

master contains my Hip-Hop/Rap playlist songs that you might of heard of.

Xtra's contain my Alternative Rock playlist songs... that you might have also heard of.

SimpleNetworks contains any files that are designed for any of SimpleNetworks' Services.



There. You get your clarification, now go download something already.
